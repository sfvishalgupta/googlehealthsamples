 ==Installing the Google Data PHP Client Library==
 
 To get started, download the Gdata component of Zend framework by visiting
 http://framework.zend.com/download/gdata.
 
 For help installing and getting started with the PHP client library, see:
 http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/articles/php_client_lib.html


==Installing Zend_Gdata_Health Library==

Unarchive the downloaded files. Four sub-directories should be created:

    * demos — Sample applications
    * documentation — Documentation for the client library files
    * library — The actual client library source files.
    * tests — Unit-test files for automated testing.

Add the location of the library folder to your PHP path.  Again, see 
http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/articles/php_client_lib.html for help.

To install the Health library (Zend_Gdata_Health), unarchive the files and place 
the contents of /library into the corresponding /library directory that was created
in the previous step.

Zend_Gdata_Health/library/*          ->  Zend/library/Zend/Gdata/

Optionally, you can also install the sample, documentation, and unit tests:
Zend_Gdata_Health/demos/HealthSample.php  ->  Zend/demos/Zend/Gdata/
Zend_Gdata_Health/documentation/*             ->  Zend/documentation/Zend/Gdata/
Zend_Gdata_Health/tests/*                          ->  Zend/tests/Zend/Gdata/

That's it!


==Using the Library==
